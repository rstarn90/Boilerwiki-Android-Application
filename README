ABOUT BOILERWIKI
-------------------------
When you don’t know something, what do you do? You ask your friends! Over the past four years, we’ve asked our friends
about their favorite date spots, what classes they’d enjoyed most, what professors were the most fun, and what bars were
the coolest. They’ve rarely let us down, but occasionally we’d run across questions no one had the answer to. And this
bugged us. Because, somewhere, someone out there had taken that class, or been to that restaurant, and they could tell
us what they thought about it. Thus, BoilerWiki was born. This site will be the chronicler of our collective college
experiences, and it will ensure that present and future Boilermakers can benefit from the wisdom of their classmates.
So get out there and get rating! Let your fellow Boilermakers know about your favorite classes, professors, dining
courts and landlords, and encourage your friends to do the same!
